# Animal Identification Game

This web application allows users to see images supplied by the Flickr API and
attempt to correctly guess the contents of the image.

Each animal group keeps track of the highest consecutive correct guesses, using
a high score value.

Users can also search for images of a specific animal breed to help prepare
for their next attempt at the identification game.
